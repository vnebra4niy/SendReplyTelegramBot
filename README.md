Telegram bot for sending out gmail emails. Functionality: send out user defined message to all emails recorded in txt file.
The user is required to have a login and a 16-character password. The bot can send a pre-made reply to unread emails (to avoid sending the same message to the same email address repeatedly).
Suppose we send messages to a newly registered user, and their possible replies say that this email is used only for sending emails.
